# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of a digital marketing campaign with the goal of understanding campaign performance, identifying areas of improvement, and assessing the likelihood of achieving specific conversion targets. The project leverages Excel and various statistical techniques to gain insights into the campaign's effectiveness.
